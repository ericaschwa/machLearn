This program does not exhibit machine learning persay. Instead, it acts as a calculator. However, possible extensions to this
program do include implementing a machine learning aspect; perhaps the user can introduce new symbols such as $ and the computer
must learn what these symbols mean

To run: python "calcluator.py"

As it currently stands, the program passes all tests, and respects order of operations (PEMDAS),
and can handle negative and floating point numbers.

Dividing by 0 is a checked runtime error, as are parentheses errors

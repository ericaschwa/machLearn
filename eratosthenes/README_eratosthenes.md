This program does not exhibit machine learning persay. Instead, it lists the
prime numbers up to a given number using the Seive of Eratosthenes algorithm.
The user inputs this stopping point number on the command line. 
User cannot input a negative number or a non-integer.

To run: python "eratosthenes.py"

As it currently stands, this program is correct all the time in finding all
prime numbers up to a given value, whenever this value is at least one,
non-negative, and an integer.
